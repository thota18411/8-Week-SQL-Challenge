t2 AS(SELECT week_number,region,platform,age_band,demographic,customer_type,SUM(sales) as sales_week
          FROM t1
          WHERE week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 36 AND year_number='2020'
          GROUP BY week_number,region,platform,age_band,demographic,customer_type)

          SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 36 THEN sales_week END) as after_change,
          SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 25 AND 36 THEN sales_week END)-SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN 13 AND 24 THEN sales_week END) as variance
          FROM t2
          GROUP BY region,platform,age_band,demographic,customer_type
