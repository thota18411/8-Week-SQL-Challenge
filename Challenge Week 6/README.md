<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Casestudy
Clique Bait is not like your regular online seafood store - the founder and CEO Danny, was also a part of a digital data analytics team and wanted to expand his knowledge into the seafood industry!

In this case study - you are required to support Dannyâ€™s vision and analyse his dataset and come up with creative solutions to calculate funnel fallout rates for the Clique Bait online store.
<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Available  Data

For this case study there is a total of 5 datasets which you will need to combine to solve all of the questions.

Table 1: User<br/>
Table 2: Events <br/>
Table 3: Event Identifier <br/>
Table 4: Campaign Identifier <br/>
Table 5: Page Hirerarchy <br/>
